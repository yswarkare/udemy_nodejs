# Using the Attached Source Code

Throughout this course, we'll write a lot of code.

To give you the possibility of comparing your code to mine (to find + fix potential errors in your code), you'll find **multiple code snapshots per module** attached to different lectures in this course.

The last **lecture of each module** always contains **all snapshots** for the module, ordered chronologically.

You can view the code and compare it to yours or replace (parts of) your code with it temporarily (to narrow down the issue).

**How do you use the attached code?**

**BEFORE** we started using npm, you simply run the main .js file via node - just as we do it in the videos. Or you simply look into the code files to view + compare the code.

**AFTER** we started using npm, you need to run `npm install` inside of the extracted code attachment before you can run npm start to run the server.
